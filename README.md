*Basic Game Foundation:

    - You are an organism.
    - Eat leaves to grow, and replenish energy.
    - Eat people smaller than you. (Less Attack Damage)
    - If you run out of energy, you shrink.
    - If your mass is zero, you die.
    - If your death age is hit, you die.
    - Reproduce before death.
    - Your organism family is your team.
    - Last team standing wins.


*Moar Detailed Game Foundation:
-   You spawn identical to every other organism.
-   As you eat food your xp increases.
-   After your xp has reached a certain point, reproduce, or buy upgrades, such as:
        - maxHealth
        - maxXp 
        - speed
        - attack power
        - defense
-   Your color represents your age, and your size represents your attack power.
-   Your health decreases when bigger organisms consume parts of you (enemy moves on top of you, the longer you are beneath it, the more health you lose (after losing your armour).)
-   All organisms will die exactly 120* seconds after spawn. Reproduce and create a bacterial culture before this.
-   Your bacterial culture represents your team.
-   After main organism dies, ownership (Alpha) of your culture is carried on to the oldest child.
-   Genetic Mutation --> (Ethan's choice on what happens here.)
-   When attacking larger organisms, your culture can attack as a group. (Josh)
-   When coast is clear, your culture can spread out to collect resources such as food and xp. (Uzair)
-   Your culture is communist, meaning all resources are shared among each other.
