Basic Game Foundation:

    - You are an organism.
    - Eat leaves to grow, and replenish energy.
    - Eat people smaller than you.
    - If you run out of energy, you shrink.
    - If your mass is zero, you die.
    - If your death age is hit, you die.
    - Reproduce before death.
    - Your organism family is your team.
    - Last team standing wins.
