Basic Game Foundation:

    - You are an organism.
    - Eat leaves to grow, and replenish energy.
    - Eat people smaller than you.
    - If you run out of energy, you shrink.
    - If your mass is zero, you die.
    - If your death age is hit, you die.
    - Reproduce before death.
    - Your organism family is your team.
    - Last team standing wins.

Variables:
    Type - Type of Organism. Each organism has different strengths and weaknesses.
        Dank, Monster, Boomer, Speedy, Normie, Noob (More on this).

    Age - There is a max age set for organisms, the organism must die after this limit.
        As the org. gets older, its attacks and defenses are weaker, meaning it will
        eat slower, and get eaten faster.

    Energy - Constantly dropping, eat food to replenish energy. Energy is used up by
        moving and reproducing.

    Size - The org. gets bigger by eating food, and smaller organisms. The organism
        gets smaller by running out of energy, and being consumed by larger organisms.

    Speed - Movement speed. The bigger an org. the slower it moves.

    Reproduction Age - Minimum age an organism needs to be to reproduce.
